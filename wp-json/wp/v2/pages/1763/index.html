Kubernetes operates on a single-tenant basis, meaning a separate cluster is required for each user.<\/p><p>In the modern world, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for deploying server workloads. Nearly every modern application is developed with the understanding that it will be running in Kubernetes. This shift has established new standards for infrastructure provisioning.<\/p><p>Have you noticed a decrease in traditional virtual machine sales? Users are now seeking smarter services to deploy their applications. They want to manage their infrastructure as code using modern tools like Terraform. Users no longer need to handle the manual configuration of virtual machines and databases. They can simple purchase managed services and not worry about anything. They can build their infrastructure out of such services using them just like building blocks.<\/p><p>Leading cloud providers have changed the way of providing infrastructure so the industry will never be the same again. Now, users expect a specific set of services from every modern cloud: Kubernetes, Simple Storage Services, Monitoring and Managed Databases, and so on.<\/p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1020\" height=\"197\" src=\"https:\/\/aenix.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/cloud_providers-3.png\" alt=\"Leading Cloud Providers\" class=\"wp-image-1815\" style=\"object-fit:cover\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aenix.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/cloud_providers-3.png 1020w, https:\/\/aenix.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/cloud_providers-3-300x58.png 300w, https:\/\/aenix.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/cloud_providers-3-768x148.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px\" \/><\/figure><\/div><p><\/p><p>Kubernetes plays a key role here because it offers a convenient and unified way to consume cloud resources and running user workloads in any cloud. For the user, Kubernetes is the same everywhere. But not for the administrator. As Kubernetes is a popular service among cloud providers, many people know how to work with it. Fewer people know how to administer it on premises, and almost no one knows how to build a full-featured managed Kubernetes service.<\/p><p>Many try to replicate the success of leading cloud providers, but most Kubernetes installations are not fully functional. As a result of such integrations they make many mistakes, eg. the data usually stored inside virtual machines breaking the flexibility, and cluster auto-scaling does not work properly. This is all due to a lack of understanding of Kubernetes concepts and the needs of end-users.<\/p><p>We have been using Kubernetes in production environments and managing it for many years. We know what your users realy want and what truly managed Kubernetes should be like. Our portfolio includes cases of organizing automatic Kubernetes provisioning on bare-metal servers, as well in virtual machines. We have extensive experience in building private and public clouds for Kubernetes, and we know how to do it right.<\/p><p>Entrust us with the creation of your own managed Kubernetes service for your users and become a reliable Kubernetes provider today!<\/p><div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-horizontal is-content-justification-left is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\"><div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-primary\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/aenix.io\/contact\/\">CONTACT US<\/a><\/div><\/div><div style=\"height:75px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Managed Kubernetes Service is a Kubernetes API in your cloud, allowing your users to request services and utilize resources from your cloud.
